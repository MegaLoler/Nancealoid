# how 2 make

type `make` duh

# how 2 use

u need jack audio server running

rn doesnt actually produce a sound source so u need to route one in (preferably a sawtooth-like wave if nothin better)




a visualizer would be cool eventually








need to figure out how to simulation plosion and frication
also need to add nasal cavity
also need to make tract length vary slightly with pitch! since the larynx MOVES
